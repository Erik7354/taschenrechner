# Taschenrechner (Calculator)

Back in 10th grade we had a little introduction to Java Swing by drawing a few rectangles.
In class I then asked my teacher for a cool project I could do at home to improve my skills. He suggested creating a Calculator.
This was the origin of V1 of this project.

## V1

V1 brings basic functionality of a calculator. Though it lacks "Punkt- vor Strichrechnung" (PEMDAS) it brings a few handy number converters with it.
Of course my teacher suggested me to add PEMDAS rules as advanced task.

## V2

V2 then added PEMDAS rules and also automatically showed the user which buttons can be pressed and disabled all others. Though the coloring for this feature seems broken.

## Disclaimer

When you review the code and probably can't believe how "good" it's structure and quality is, please remember that I wrote this code long ago as one of my first ever projects.
For the authenticity I don't wanted to change anything. Even if that means the code isn't perfect, it's at least authentic. 
Unfortunately it's not bug free. Can you find them?ðŸª²
